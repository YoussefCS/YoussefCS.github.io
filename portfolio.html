        <p> The game is about a person who tries to run and survive to win <br>
        the game. The scoring system is the levels as every level you pass <br>
        it increase by 1.In level 4, there is a bridge that changes randomly<br>
        from 6 costumes. This game gets difficult through the levels; the more<br>
        levels you pass, the harder it gets. The game ends when you pass all the levels but, you <br>
        restart all over if you die.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> I created this game because I saw a game before about the same <br>
        thing and I really liked it. Two succcessful points in my game were<br>
        how the main character moves and how he dies. However, two obstacles <br>
        that I had were how to get spirts disapear in time and how to jump.<br>
        I overcome them by getting help and a lot of me trying. If I had more<br>
        time, I would add more levels and better jumping.

        <p>This code allows the level to change. As the level number increase,<br>
        the level change which is the background. so, if leve=4 then, the level<br>
        will change to level 4 background.

        <p>My story talks about a person that loses everything. This happens <br>
        so fast that he doesnâ€™t know what to do. After all this he finds <br>
        something, he finds hope in a better life and he have a decision to make<br>
        and this decision is going to decide everything.</p>

        <p>The story code was split in two parts incremental and iterative. The<br>
        incremental part were the choices and the story while, the iterative <br>
        part were the scenes and the starting code to make it type on the screen.<br>
        One of the advantages in abstracting my story into functions where it made<br>
        the story flow easier and without delays.Also, it made it easier to type.<br>
        I liked "the adventures of spiderham" story because it was long and had many <br>
        choices which made it fun. Also, I liked "Adventure time" story because <br>
        it was simple and easy to go through.</p>
